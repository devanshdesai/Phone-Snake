# Phone Snake

Phone Snake is a game I created to explore the HTML canvas. I wanted to do something like snake but with a twist. The objective is to successfully enter your phone number. There are three difficulties: easy, medium, and hard.

**Fun Fact:** Even I haven't beat the game on hard.

Try entering your phone number and see how it goes!

The game can be found [here](http://devanshdesai.com/projects/PhoneSnake/index.html#).
